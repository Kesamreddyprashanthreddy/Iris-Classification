Introduction
The Iris Classification Project demonstrates supervised learning by classifying three species of Iris flowers: Iris Setosa, Iris Versicolor, and Iris Virginica. This repository leverages machine learning techniques to achieve accurate predictions.


Dataset Description
The Iris dataset consists of 150 samples, each described by four features:

Sepal length
Sepal width
Petal length
Petal width

The dataset is available as part of the UCI Machine Learning Repository.
